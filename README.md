# Noah Dog - Does he really got that dog in 'em?

# Logic:
1. Press button/lever to "spin"
2. Headshots will cycle through
    if he's a dog, a photo of a dog will show and display "he's got that dog in em"
    if he's NOT a dog, it'll just keep a random headshot of Noah
3. Show below: "He's got that DOG in 'em" or "He ain't got that DOG in 'em"
4. Add a user-dynamic betting section
    - Move to above the lever
5. Add a pie chart for W/L
6. Add a total dollar amount won/lost as "Wallet"
