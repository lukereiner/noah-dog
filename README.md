# Got that dog in me

# Logic:
1. Press button/lever to "spin"
2. Headshots will cycle through
    if he's a dog, a photo of a dog will show and display "he's got that dog in em"
    if he's NOT a dog, it'll just keep a random headshot of Noah
3. Show below: "He's got that DOG in 'em" or "He ain't got that DOG in 'em"

4. **Add a user-dynamic betting section
    - Move to above the lever**
5. **Add a total dollar amount won/lost as "Wallet"
    - Has to have access to WAGERNUMBER
    - Takes WAGERNUMBER and adds or subtracts based on noah win**
6. **Add a pie chart for W/L
    - Remove the W/L section above to the pie chart
    - Make photo and lever positions static
        - Starting position gets centered and pushed out**
7. Add functionality to save data to a database
    - I can self-host with docker or signup for a free tier managed service on supabase
8. Add a scheduled daily run IF a run hasn't happened by 23:45
9. EXTRA - Add daily or monthly email to get updates on stats
